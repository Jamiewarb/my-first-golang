# My First Golang

This repository contains the first ever golang programs I've written.

I started looking at Go on 15th June 2022, and this documents the (hopefully) evolving skillset.

The directories are numbered from 0 upwards in the order they were written. In an ideal word, the higher the number, the more complex.

Enjoy.

## Notes

I found this video from Gopherfest 2015 on Go Proverbs from Rob Pike very interesting.

It gave some good insights into the culture behind Go
